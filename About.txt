In this node js application I made a short url service in which user can create short URLs of 
the long URLs. In this application user can signup, login, and see the complete list of short URLs.
Individual users can only see his/her list of short URLs.Basic authentication is implemented in this application.
JWT authentication and authorization to different roles code also added.
